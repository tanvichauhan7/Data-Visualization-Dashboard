# Project Title: Data-Visualization-Dashboard

Description:-A platform which allows the user to represent data in three forms of charts:- Pie chart, Bar Graph and Dot Graph. Users can edit the number of data points and generate the corresponding graph.

Problem Statement:- In todayâ€™s digital world, organizations collect massive amounts of data every day. However, raw data is often too complex to understand and act upon. Without proper visualization, valuable insights remain hidden. Our dashboard was built to transform complex datasets into clear, interactive visuals, making data-driven decisions easier and faster.

Features of the Project:
-> Real-time data updates for live monitoring.
-> Dynamic graphs that update when data changes.
-> Clickable graphs for drilling down into details.
-> Customizable dashboard (users can choose chart types/layout).
-> Clean and minimal UI for non-technical users.

Tech Stack Used:
-> HTML
-> CSS
-> JavaScript
